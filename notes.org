* README
  The idea is to keep everything in a single .org file,
  including both contents and configurations.
  This .org file can also be used for publishing pdf articles,
  web pages, etc. using org-modes export functionalities.

  For availabe features, please refer to the comments/source-codes below.

** ISSUES
** WISH-LIST
   - [ ] CAPTURE and refile as a subtree in this note
     - [ ] Deal with duplicate outline-headline in different captures.
     - [ ] Sanitizers for title and export-file-name.
     - [ ] Consider a more generic syntax for function-finding-location.

* SRC
** Generic elisp utilities
*** Genpath
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mon-genpath (path-elem &optional absolute)
    (let ((relative-path (mapconcat 'directory-file-name path-elem "/")))
      (if absolute
          (expand-file-name relative-path)
        relative-path)))
  ;; Example:
  ;; (message (mon-genpath (list "a" "b" "c.txt")))
#+END_SRC

** Generic org-mode utilities
*** Org-outline to filename
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mon-org-outline-to-org-filename (&optional base-directory)
    (mon-org-outline-to-filename ".org" base-directory))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mon-org-outline-to-filename (&optional extension base-directory)
    "Note: non-nil (file) extension contains the leading dot.
  "
    (let ((filename
           (concat (org-display-outline-path nil t "/" t) extension)))

      (if base-directory
          (expand-file-name
           filename (file-name-as-directory base-directory))
        filename)))
#+END_SRC
*** Org-outline heading (get-function)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun mon-org-outline-get-heading ()
    (org-get-heading "no-tags" "no-todo" "no-priority" "no-comment"))
  ;; Although calling (org-heading-components) and then retrieving
  ;; the 4th-element necessarily does the same thing,
  ;; org-get-heading is more intuitive, provides better abstraction.

** CAPTURE and refile as a subtree in this note
*** Capture Templates
